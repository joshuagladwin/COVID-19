# COVID-19
Tracking the COVID-19 Outbreak using the data from European Centre of Disease Prevention and Control, the [EDCD](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/download-todays-data-geographic-distribution-covid-19-cases-worldwide), which is updated daily with the latest figures from disease centres around the world.

You can view and interact with the Plotly charts in the notebook [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/joshuagladwin/COVID-19/blob/master/COVID-19.ipynb).


## Update 8th June 2020

* Converted Matplotlib graphs to Plotly.
* Now collecting and saving a copy of the ECDC data locally. See \Data

## Update 24th May 2020

 * Discontinued the 'Total No. of Confirmed Cases and Deaths Globally Yesterday'. Not sure what it's adding to the analysis that the main 'Total No. of Cases and Deaths Globally' isn't already adding.
